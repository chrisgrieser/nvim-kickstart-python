1. nvim-kickstart-python         *nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python*

A launch point for your nvim config for python.

Similar to kickstart.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim>, but
specifically for python.

MOTIVATION            *nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-motivation*

While there are quite a few great nvim distros and nvim starter configs out
there, one thing I somewhat missed was a base config for specific languages. I
recently started to learn python and was missing a minimal example what the
state-of-the-art nvim setup specifically for python is.

After figuring most of it out, I decided to publish this config for others to
use. It is intended as a launch point for python devs switching to nvim, or as
a reference for nvim users who want to start doing python development.


PHILOSOPHY & FEATURES*nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-philosophy-&-features*

- This is not a nvim distro, this is a _minimal_ nvim config specifically for
    python. Itâ€™s intended as a starting point for creating your own config.
- Requirement: nvim 0.10.
- ~15 plugins, ~350 lines, everything in one single file.
- Includes detailed comments explaining what the config does.
- The config can be fully bootstrapped: all plugins and tools are automatically
    installed on startup.
- Uses the current state-of-the-art of the nvim plugin ecosystem.
- Includes some common tooling for python development:
    - LSP (Completion, Typing): `pyright`
    - Linting (Diagnostics): `ruff`
    - Formatting: `black` & `isort`
    - Debugger: `debugpy`
    - Embedded REPL: `ipython` (if not installed, falls back to `python3`)
- In addition, this config includes editing utilities specifically for python,
    like for example docstrings creation, selecting virtual environments, or
    auto-converting f-strings.


RECOMMENDATION    *nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-recommendation*

Go through the kickstart-python.lua <./kickstart-python.lua>, it is commented
in detail.

You can copypaste the config into you current `init.lua` to use it as a
starting point for your regular config, or you can copypaste parts of it into
your existing config.


DOWNLOAD                *nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-download*

`kickstart-python` requires at least nvim 0.10.

Download the kickstart-python.lua <./kickstart-python.lua> file and run Neovim
with it:

>bash
    # download the config
    curl --remote-name "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-kickstart-python/main/kickstart-python.lua"
    
    # start neovim with the config, opening a file `foobar.py`
    # (any existing config you are using remains untouched)
    nvim -u kickstart-python.lua foobar.py
<

The config automatically installs all the plugins and tooling needed.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING*nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-syntax-highlighting*

Is provided by the nvim-treesitter
<https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter> plugin and/or the semshi
<https://github.com/numirias/semshi> plugin. The latter requires `pynvim`
(`python3 -m pip install pynvim`) to be installed.

Both provide better highlighting, Treesitter is considered the more "modern"
approach. Treesitter covers some cases `semshi` does not and vice versa. Have a
look at the comparison <./treesitter-or-semshi.md> to decide for yourself which
one to use. The config uses Treesitter as the more modern approach.


ADDITIONAL PLUGINS OF INTEREST*nvim-kickstart-python-nvim-kickstart-python-additional-plugins-of-interest*

In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in
